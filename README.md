## Descriptions

Odin Battleship is a web-based implementation of the classic Battleship game. This project allows players to place ships on a gameboard and engage in a turn-based battle with either a human opponent or a computer AI.

## Features

- **Ship Placement**: Players can place ships on a grid with options to rotate the ships for strategic positioning.
- **Human vs AI Mode**: Play against an AI that automatically places its ships and chooses attack coordinates.
- **Touch and Hold to Rotate**: On mobile devices, players can long-press to rotate ships during placement.
- **Right-Click to Rotate**: On non-touch devices (PC or laptop), players can use right-click to rotate the ships.
- **Dynamic Turn-Based Gameplay**: Turns automatically switch between the player until all ships are sunk.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is optimized for both desktop and mobile experiences.
- **Game Over Handling**: Displays the results when all ships of one player are sunk, with an option to restart.
- **Error Prevention**: Prevents invalid ship placements and ensures that no actions can proceed unless they are valid.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For implementing game logic and handling player interactions.
- **HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the game interface.
- **Jest**: For unit testing to ensure the functionality of the game components.
- **Webpack**: For bundling JavaScript modules and assets.
